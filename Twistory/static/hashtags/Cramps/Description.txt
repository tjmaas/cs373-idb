#Cramps was trending in late June 2014 and is related to when the air conditioning went out at the AT&T center in San Antonio, Texas during game 1 of the 2014 NBA finals. LeBron James cramped up and wasn't able to finish the game. The graph clearly shows a spike in the hashtag right as game 1 was occuring.
